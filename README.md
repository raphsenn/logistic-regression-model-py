### Sigmoid function
The *sigmoid function*, which is also known as the *standard logistic function* is defined as \sigma(x) = .
The *sigmoid function* needs to satisfy three properties *P1 - P3*.

Let  \sigma(x)  be the sigmoid function, it needs to satisfy.
  * P1 \lim_{x \to -inf} \sigma(x) = 0, \lim_{x \to inf} \sigma(x) = 1, \lim_{x \to 0} \sigma(x) = 1/2
  *
